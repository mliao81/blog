**Who Am I?**
Hi. I'm Michelle Liao. A high school student at the Quarry Lane School. I'm really interested in electronics, so I thought I would make a blog to document what I'm learning and creating. Or whatever else I like. 

<!--- I am the president of Dublin Youth Innovation, an organization with the mission of spreading engineering and science in Dublin, California. My favorite aspect of DYI is collaborating closely with community centers to create devices that improve people's lives.

Some other things I do is lead QLS's Arduino Club and FRC Robotics Team. --->

**Current Stuff:**



**Website**
I used Jekyll/Github pages with the [Ghost/Jasper2](https://ghost.org/) layout to create this website.
